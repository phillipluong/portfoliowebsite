My name is Phillip Luong and I am an Applied Mathematics and Statistics Honours Graduate from Monash University. Currently I work at Monash as a Teaching Associate at Monash University.

This website is designed for me to publish various blog posts of different things I learn about data wrangling and data science as I go. Currently I am interested in projects related to Machine Learning (notably Graph Neural Networks). I am doing most of my coding via Jupyter Notebook and have been learning the basics of PyTorch for my Neural Networks.

In my spare time, I have been practicing _Litefeet_, a new age hip hop style originating from New York. I am also an avid board games and autochess player.
