Continuing my quest for different dataset analyses and learning basic deep learning techniques, I decided to use some variants of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short Term Memories (LSTMs) to compute the accuracy of predicting different articles of clothing. 

There are a lot of great resources on the web that have great explanations and visualisations of RNNs and LSTMs. I think a great summary of the methods is a set of processes that allow to retain information from a sequences and their patterns within. The latter methods had processes that incorporated information to retain long-term or more recent information.

I anaylsed the Fashion-MNIST dataset, looked at how the dataset can be fed into a RNNs and LSTMs to train and predict the type of clothing. I decided to look at both techniques to compare the differences and physically see how LSTMs improve on the RNN framework. 

Here is some code:

class RNNModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, hidden_dim, layer_dim, output_dim):
        super(RNNModel, self).__init__()
        
        # Hidden Dimensions
        self.hidden_dim = hidden_dim
        
        # Number of Hidden Layers
        self.layer_dim = layer_dim
        
        # Building your RNN
        # batch_first = True causes input/output tensors to be of shape
        # (batch_dim, seq_dim, input_dim)
        # batch_dim = number of samples per batch
        self.rnn = nn.RNN(input_dim, hidden_dim, layer_dim, batch_first=True, nonlinearity='relu')
        
        # Readout layer
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, output_dim)
        
    def forward(self, x):
        # Initialize hidden state with zeros
        # (layer_dim, batch_size, hidden_dim)
        h0 = torch.zeros(self.layer_dim, x.size(0), self.hidden_dim).requires_grad_()
        
        # We need to detach the hidden state to prevent exploding/vanishing gradients
        # This is part of the truncated backpropagation through time (BPTT)
        out, hn = self.rnn(x, h0.detach())
        
        # Index hidden state of last time step
        # out.size() --> 100, 28, 10
        # out[:, -1, :] --> 100, 10 --> just want last time step hidden states!
        out = self.fc(out[:, -1, :])
        # out.size() --> 100, 10
        return out

After conducting experiments with four different models (two RNN and two LSTM models with different parameters), the single-layer LSTM model worked best.
