I can't deny that I have been somewhat addicted to this game over the past three or so months, but Teamfight Tactics (TFT) has been a good way for me to wind down a day's worth of work. Nonetheless, my obsession to play around with data is still there at the night, which is why I have spent a rediculous amount of time aggregating data from my own games. 

I finally decided to spend some time analysing this data to see if it could help my gameplay in TFT.

I would write a bit more of an introduction for this blog, but the amount of depth of this Exploratory Data Analysis did honestly tire me out this time. [Please check it out!](https://github.com/phillipluong/TFT-Set4-EDA)
