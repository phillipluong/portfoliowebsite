I can't deny that I have been somewhat addicted to this game over the past three or so months, but Teamfight Tactics (TFT) has been a good way for me to wind down a day's worth of work. Nonetheless, my obsession to play around with data is still there at the night, which is why I have spent a rediculous amount of time aggregating data from my own games. 

One of the things that excites me about the game is the plethora of data that you can collect from the game, ranging from personal statistics about the different boards you play (and then use to analyse to improve your performance), to looking holistically at what boards the rest of the world is playing, and consequently which units, compositions and items are performing better than others. A huge thanks to websites such as tactics.tools, metatft, and tftactics for making their analyses so accessible!

The data is only one part of it. The other enjoyable aspect is the active risk management problems you're trying to solve while playing the game. In live-time you're constantly trying to think about making your board stronger than others by purchasing units in your own shop, equipping and combining appropriate items with your units, and positioning your units effectively to give yourself the best chance to best your opponent's team. To play optimally, there are moments within a game where you may have to make about 70 calculated moves within the span of 15 seconds whilst keeping in mind your 7 other opponents.

With the fusion of data analysis outside of games and probability management within the game, TFT has easily become one of the most enjoyable pastimes. I thought it might be interesting to do a little bit of data viz and data analysis on my own games just to keep my python mind running.
