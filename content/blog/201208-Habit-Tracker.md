It's been a while! A couple of months ago I got a bit of motivation from a friend to create my own dashboard to analyse my own habits and analyse which habits lead to 'better' days (in the most subjective way possible). I had previously recorded this via an excel sheet between October 2019 to March 2020, and wanted to keep up a habit like that again.

Just as my friend created the dashboard via excel, I decided to customise it a bit and translate it to Python, with a couple of goals in mind of the dashboard:

- The dashboard must be flexible enough so that I could add new columns/habits/concepts onto my excel sheet easily
- The dashboard will show graphs that will give me applicable information. 
- The dashboard must be somewhat good looking

This was quite a long process, but I ultimately ended up getting it done! With a couple of good findings. However, keeping the habit of regularly updating the dataset has kind of fallen off since then, I intend on continuing that as soon as possible!
